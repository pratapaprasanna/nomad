- Discord https://discord.com/channels/876714663059025921/876714833150631996

### Usecases

- The model is primarily on subscription basis

#### Update Module

  - User subscribes to a state/city and user get all the updates regarding the state for the next 14days (configurable)

  - Updates can be pulled from the following social platforms

      - Nomad (itself)
      If the API's are exposed then from the following as well
      - Facebook
      - Twitter
      - Instagram

  - User upon logging to nomad should be able to visit the list of most visited and least visited places

      - Initially we can publish from the governments regular tourist sites. Moving forward we can update based on the nomad users activities

#### Expereince Module
   - Nomad should allow users to share their experiences which can include
      - Text/Picute/Video {forcing using to share the location}
      - Describing the place - Disturbance faced while visiting the place.
      - Any happening thing like a concert/sale/restaurant
      - Any accomadation or any discounted accomadation in a needy hour.
      - Any viewpoint/unexplored place that people can visit. If remote,nearest landmark and a text to direct users to the location.
   - Users should also be able to share the same post into their social-media profile using a share option.
   - Users should also have option to post an advertisement/seeking help to collect any misplaced or forgotten itenary.
      - Followed by instant chat/messaging portal to discuss
        (We dont want to encourage to share mobile numbers in nomad. However they can share numbers in chat)
   - Users should have option called Team-up which redirects to chat/module this helps solo-travellers

#### Chat Module

   - Nomad should have a small chat platform which is available only for team-up and advertisement activities.

#### User Rating Module

   - Based on the activity user will be given a rating like in zomato/ola
      - This will help users in deciding in seeking help/ teaming-up
   - Report abuse option for every post where fellow users can report and nomad will block the user upon reaching threshold

#### Benefit Module

   - Nomad Users have to be awarded for their contribution for taking time to update
   - It can nomad points which upon accumilation he can get them re-imbursed in hotels for accomadation or food

- Once user subcription ends he can subscribe again to get the updates again

## Success Criteria

- Any traveller should consider having nomad in his travel itenary.
