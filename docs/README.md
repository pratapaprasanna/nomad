## Idea

- Nomad is a social platform to unite all travellers to build more helpful eco-system during the journey.

# Dependencies

## Stay updated with

- Discord <https://discord.com/channels/876714663059025921/876714833150631996>

### Usecases

- The model is primarily on subscription basis

#### Update Module

- User subscribes to a state/city and user get all the updates regarding the state for the next 14days (configurable)

- Updates can be pulled from the following social platforms

  - Nomad (itself)
      If the API's are exposed then from the following as well
  - Facebook
  - Twitter
  - Instagram

- User upon logging to nomad should be able to visit the list of most visited and least visited places

  - Initially we can publish from the governments regular tourist sites. Moving forward we can update based on the nomad users activities
  - It should also categorize the location like if the location is known for
    - Trekking
    - Historical-site
    - Devotional
    - Fun park etc.

#### Expereince Module

- Nomad should allow users to share their experiences which can include
  - Text/Picute/Video {forcing using to share the location}
  - Describing the place - Disturbance faced while visiting the place.
  - Any happening thing like a concert/sale/restaurant
  - Any accomadation or any discounted accomadation in a needy hour.
  - Any viewpoint/unexplored place that people can visit. If remote,nearest landmark and a text to direct users to the location.
- Users should also be able to share the same post into their social-media profile using a share option.
- Users should also have option to post an advertisement/seeking help to collect any misplaced or forgotten itenary.
  - Followed by instant chat/messaging module portal to discuss
        (We dont want to encourage to share mobile numbers in nomad. However they can share numbers in chat)
- Users should have option called Team-up which redirects to searching for people nearby who are looking to team-up followed by moving to chat module this helps solo-travellers

#### Chat Module

- Nomad should have a small chat platform which is available only for team-up and advertisement activities.

#### User Rating Module

- Based on the activity user will be given a rating like in zomato/ola
  - This will help users in deciding in seeking help/ teaming-up
- Report abuse option for every post where fellow users can report and nomad will block the user upon reaching threshold

#### Benefit Module

- Nomad Users have to be awarded for their contribution for taking time to update
- It can nomad points which upon accumilation he can get them re-imbursed in hotels for accomadation or food

- Once user subcription ends he can subscribe again to get the updates again

## Success Criteria

- Any traveller should consider having nomad in his travel itenary.
